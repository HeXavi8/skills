## Phase 1: Information Gathering

### Step 1.1: Fetch Primary Embodied AI Sources

Use `mcp__web_reader__webReader` to fetch content from **3-5 sources** per session.

**Source Selection** (refer to `news_sources.md` for full list):

| Priority | Source                 | URL                                         | Why                               |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Always   | The Robot Report       | `https://www.therobotreport.com/`           | Best dedicated robotics news site |
| Always   | IEEE Spectrum Robotics | `https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/robotics/` | Authoritative, technical depth    |
| Always   | TechCrunch Robotics    | `https://techcrunch.com/category/robotics/` | Funding, launches, business       |
| Rotate   | VentureBeat AI         | `https://venturebeat.com/category/ai/`      | Industry analysis                 |
| Rotate   | Synced Review          | `https://syncedreview.com/`                 | China + global AI research        |
| Rotate   | QbitAI (量子位)        | `https://www.qbitai.com/`                   | China ecosystem (Chinese)         |
| Rotate   | Hugging Face Blog      | `https://huggingface.co/blog`               | Open-source model releases        |
| Rotate   | NVIDIA Blog            | `https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/`        | Isaac / GR00T updates             |

**Parameters**:

- `return_format`: markdown
- `with_images_summary`: false
- `timeout`: 20 seconds per source

**Selection Rule**: Always fetch the 3 "Always" sources. Rotate among the "Rotate" sources based on the user's focus area or the day of the week.

---

### Step 1.2: Execute Web Search Queries

Use `WebSearch` with domain-specific queries from `search_queries.md`.

**For Daily Briefing** — use **Recipe A** (5 queries):

```
Q1 — General:
("embodied AI" OR "humanoid robot") AND ("news" OR "announcement") after:[yesterday]

Q2 — Foundation Models:
("robot foundation model" OR "VLA" OR "diffusion policy") AND ("new" OR "paper") after:[yesterday]

Q3 — Key Companies:
("Tesla Optimus" OR "Figure AI" OR "Boston Dynamics" OR "Unitree" OR "AGIBOT") after:[yesterday]

Q4 — Funding:
("robotics funding" OR "robot startup") AND ("raise" OR "funding") after:[7 days ago]

Q5 — Core Media:
site:therobotreport.com OR site:spectrum.ieee.org ("robot") after:[yesterday]
```

**For Weekly Deep Dive** — add **Recipe B** (research) + **Recipe C** (commercial):

```
Q6 — arXiv Research:
site:arxiv.org ("cs.RO") AND ("embodied" OR "VLA" OR "manipulation" OR "humanoid") after:[7 days ago]

Q7 — Algorithms:
("diffusion policy" OR "world model" OR "imitation learning") AND ("robot") after:[7 days ago]

Q8 — Deployments:
("robot deployment" OR "robot factory" OR "warehouse robot") AND ("humanoid" OR "embodied") after:[7 days ago]

Q9 — Supply Chain:
("robot actuator" OR "dexterous hand" OR "robot supply chain") after:[7 days ago]
```

**For China Focus** — add **Recipe D**:

```
Q10: ("Unitree" OR "AGIBOT" OR "UBTECH" OR "Galbot" OR "Fourier") after:[7 days ago]
Q11: ("China humanoid robot" OR "China embodied AI" OR "具身智能" OR "人形机器人") after:[7 days ago]
```

**Date Variable Rules**:

- `[yesterday]` = current date minus 1 day, format: YYYY-MM-DD
- `[7 days ago]` = current date minus 7 days
- `[30 days ago]` = current date minus 30 days
- Always compute dynamically based on the current date at execution time

**Best Practices**:

- Execute 3-5 queries for daily, 8-11 queries for weekly
- Limit to top 10 results per query
- Prioritize results from last 24-48 hours for daily

---

### Step 1.3: Scan arXiv for Recent Papers

Use `WebSearch` with arXiv-specific queries:

```
site:arxiv.org ("cs.RO" OR "cs.AI" OR "cs.LG") AND ("embodied" OR "humanoid" OR "manipulation" OR "VLA" OR "diffusion policy" OR "world model") after:[yesterday]
```

For promising papers found, use `mcp__arxiv__readURL` to fetch full paper content:

- Extract title, authors, abstract, key contributions
- Note if code/model weights are released (open-source flag)
- Check if from a Tier 1 lab (see `taxonomy.md` § 4.3)

---

### Step 1.4: Fetch Full Articles

For the top **8-15 most relevant stories** from Steps 1.1-1.3:

- Extract URLs from search results and site fetches
- Use `mcp__web_reader__webReader` to fetch full article content
- This ensures accurate summarization vs. relying on snippets

**Priority for full fetch**:

1. Stories appearing in multiple search results (high signal)
2. Stories from Tier 1 sources (see `news_sources.md`)
3. Stories mentioning key companies or technologies (see `taxonomy.md`)
4. Stories with funding amounts, deployment numbers, or benchmark results

---

## Phase 2: Content Filtering

### 2.1 Recency Filter

| Briefing Type | Keep             | Remove             |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Daily         | Last 24-48 hours | Older than 3 days  |
| Weekly        | Last 7 days      | Older than 10 days |
| Monthly       | Last 30 days     | Older than 45 days |

Exception: Keep older content if it's a landmark paper or announcement that hasn't been covered yet.

### 2.2 Relevance Filter

**Must be about at least one of**:

- Humanoid / legged / mobile manipulation robots
- Robot learning (VLA, RL, IL, diffusion policy, world model)
- Robot hardware (actuators, hands, sensors, compute)
- Robot simulation & benchmarks
- Robot deployment in real-world settings
- Robotics funding, M&A, or market analysis
- Robot safety, regulation, or policy
- Embodied AI research from top labs

**Exclude** (noise exclusion — append to queries if needed):

```
NOT "Roomba" NOT "RPA" NOT "software robot" NOT "chatbot"
NOT "crypto" NOT "blockchain" NOT "trading bot"
NOT "autonomous vehicle" NOT "self-driving" (unless explicitly about robot-vehicle crossover)
NOT "drone delivery" (unless about manipulation-capable drones)
```

### 2.3 Deduplication

When the same event appears in multiple sources:

- **Keep** the most comprehensive / authoritative version
- **Note** alternative sources as secondary links
- **Priority**: Company blog > dedicated robotics media > general tech media > aggregators
- **Merge** if two articles cover different angles of the same story

---

## Phase 3: Classification

Assign each story to **exactly 1 primary category** and **0-2 secondary tags**.

Use the category system from `taxonomy.md` § 1:

| Category                           | Icon | Assign When...                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Major Announcements**            | 🔥   | New product launch, paradigm-shifting demo, >$500M funding, first-ever milestone                  |
| **Foundation Models & Algorithms** | 🧠   | New model release, SOTA result, open-source drop, novel architecture                              |
| **Hardware & Platforms**           | 🦾   | New robot, component breakthrough, spec upgrade, supply chain                                     |
| **Simulation & Infrastructure**    | 🌐   | Sim platform update, new benchmark, dataset release, ROS update                                   |
| **Deployments & Commercial**       | 🏭   | Real-world deployment, customer announcement, performance metrics                                 |
| **Funding, M&A & Business**        | 💰   | Funding round, acquisition, IPO, market report                                                    |
| **Policy, Safety & Ethics**        | 🌍   | Regulation, safety standard, export control, labor impact                                         |
| **China Ecosystem**                | 🇨🇳   | China-specific company, policy, supply chain (as primary only when China angle is the main story) |

**Classification Rules**:

- "Unitree raises $500M" → Primary: 💰, Secondary: 🇨🇳, 🦾
- "New VLA paper from Stanford" → Primary: 🧠
- "Figure deploys 100 robots at BMW" → Primary: 🏭, Secondary: 🔥
- "NVIDIA releases Isaac Lab 2.0" → Primary: 🌐
- "EU proposes robot safety framework" → Primary: 🌍
- When in doubt: ask "What would the reader want to learn from this?" — that's the primary

## Phase 4: Prioritization

### Scoring Criteria

Score each story on 4 dimensions (each 1-5):

| Dimension             | 5 (Highest)                                     | 3 (Medium)                       | 1 (Lowest)                |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Source Tier**       | Tier 1 (Robot Report, IEEE) or company official | Tier 2 (TechCrunch, VentureBeat) | Tier 3 (aggregator, blog) |
| **Recency**           | Today                                           | Yesterday                        | 3-7 days ago              |
| **Discussion Volume** | Trending on X, >5 outlets covering              | 2-3 outlets                      | Single source             |
| **Novelty**           | First-ever, paradigm shift                      | Incremental improvement          | Expected update           |

**Composite Score** = Source Tier + Recency + Discussion Volume + Novelty (max 20)

### Selection Thresholds

| Briefing Type    | Target Stories | Minimum Score |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| Daily (Brief)    | 5-6            | ≥ 12          |
| Daily (Standard) | 8-10           | ≥ 10          |
| Weekly (Deep)    | 12-18          | ≥ 8           |

### Must-Include Rules (override scoring)

### Embodied AI-Specific Quality Rules

| Rule                                                        | Why                                                             |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Always distinguish "demo video" from "real deployment"      | Demos are common; real deployments are rare and more newsworthy |
| Always note if a paper includes open-source code/weights    | This is a key differentiator for the community                  |
| Always include robot name + generation for hardware stories | Readers need to track which version is being discussed          |
| Always convert funding to USD for consistency               | Chinese companies often announce in RMB                         |
| Always note sim-only vs. real-robot results for research    | Sim results alone are less impactful                            |
| Flag "first-ever" claims with appropriate skepticism        | Verify against `taxonomy.md` to check if it's truly novel       |

| `webReader` fails for a URL         | Site down, paywall, timeout                         | Skip and try next source; note "could not access"                                                       |
| Search returns 0 results            | Query too narrow or date too recent                 | Expand date range to 3 days; broaden terms                                                              |
| Search returns >50 results          | Query too broad                                     | Add domain-specific terms; add NOT filters                                                              |
| Too few stories (<3)                | Slow news day                                       | Expand to 48h window; add more source sites; include "developing stories" from earlier                  |
| Too many stories (>15)              | Major event or conference                           | Raise significance threshold; group related stories; use Brief format                                   |
| Paywall blocks content              | Premium publication                                 | Use available excerpt; note "[Full article behind paywall]"; try alternative source                     |
| arXiv paper fetch fails             | URL format issue                                    | Verify URL starts with `https://arxiv.org/abs/`; retry                                                  |
| Chinese source returns garbled text | Encoding issue                                      | Try alternative Chinese source; use English coverage of same story                                      |
| Cannot determine publication date   | Missing metadata                                    | Check article body for date references; if uncertain, mark as "[Date unconfirmed]"                      |
| Story relevance is ambiguous        | Edge case (e.g., autonomous vehicle + manipulation) | Include if it involves physical manipulation or embodied learning; exclude if purely navigation/driving |
