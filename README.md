# skills

A small collection of agent "skills" — each skill is a self-contained utility with a `SKILL.md` that documents usage and examples.

Available skills

- [qrcode](qrcode/SKILL.md) — Generate styled QR codes (SVG/PNG/JPG) from text or URLs; supports color, dot/eye shapes, error correction and prints an `OUTPUT_FILE:` marker after generation.
- [embodied-ai-news](embodied-ai-news/SKILL.md) — Aggregates and summarizes the latest embodied AI / robotics news (daily/weekly briefings, source recipes, and templates).

Run a skill by following the examples in its `SKILL.md` (most are Node-based and include `npm install` instructions when needed).
